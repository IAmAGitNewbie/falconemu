Hello,

This is a new EMU For World of Warcraft called Falcom Emu. It is open source and free for anyone to use. Right now it is currently in the planning stage. We hope to have a beta out by 2008. Also we are hiring skilled coders...mainly skilled at C. This emu is released under the GNU License. Please check in often for the latest updates.
